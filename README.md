Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? 
	I think the biggest struggle was having very little or vague instructions about what libraries to import.
	I based a lot of the imports on past exercises. In particular, it seemed like Mike was using the latest version of js that looked like it was still in alpha.

	I don't know if that had anything to do with it but I failed miserably at using Font Awesome because it waasn't importing and had to rely on using raty. Also, raty doesn't come with svg or icons other than the stars and some cancel icons. So I had to get creative about the up and down voting buttons.
